# Intro

Simple project for trying to understand how "agentic" LLM frameworks work. This basically lead me to writing my own (and much much worse) `pydantic-ai` library. 

Notes:
- only written as an exploration on how to de-spaghettify some work LLM projects
- the typing is incorrect
- the code isn't that pretty
- written in one day -> use at your own peril
- no tests
